            <h2>The Career Arc</h2>
            <p>I did not start as a theorist. I am an operator who has fixed broken machines at every level of the
                enterprise.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>THE OPERATING THESIS</strong>
                "You cannot govern a roadmap if you do not own the budget. Innovation without operation is
                hallucination."
            </div>

            <h3>Phase 1: The Operator (Director of Operations)</h3>
            <p>Before I led Product, I led P&Ls. As a Director of Operations and Chief of Staff for a mid-market firm, I
                didn't just ship features—I owned the bottom line. I inherited a stagnant P&L and fractured silos. By
                instituting operational rigor and consolidating disjointed teams, I drove <strong>200% year-over-year
                    growth to $20M</strong>.</p>
            <p>This period taught me that "efficiency" isn't about cutting costs; it's about killing the activities that
                don't compound capital.</p>

            <h3>Phase 2: The Scaler (Director of Product)</h3>
            <p>I transitioned to product leadership with a mandate to fix "broken velocity." At a major enterprise firm,
                I inherited a paralyzing 200-item backlog and a team shipping nothing. I installed a <strong>"Quantified
                    Prioritization System"</strong> that doubled output and slashed a $5M operational cost via a complex
                Azure cloud migration.</p>
            <p>In the public sector, I managed critical infrastructure for <strong>7.7 million users</strong>,
                delivering a massive technology overhaul with 98% on-time delivery in a zero-fail environment.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3: The Board Advisor (Product Economist)</h3>
            <p>Today, I serve on Advisory Boards and function as a Fractional Executive. I bridged the gap between code
                and capital for "Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow" and act as a Contributing Expert for Foundry.</p>
            <p>I created the <strong>Office of the Product Economist</strong> because I realized that as AI scales, the
                "Innovation Tax" is becoming a solvency risk. Boards needed a new language to manage probabilistic cost.
