                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Legacy software is a shadow liability. Most organizations fail to
                        account for the "carry cost" of code that generates no marginal value. We must deploy a
                        "Governance of Subtraction".</p>

                    <h3>1. The Carry Cost of Code</h3>
                    <p>Every line of code in production is a liability, not an asset. It requires compute, human
                        maintenance, and cognitive load. When features do not generate revenue in excess of their total
                        carry cost, they are not "features"—they are taxes.</p>

                    <h3>2. Subtraction as Strategy</h3>
                    <p>The role of the Product Economist is not to approve new build; it is to calculate the solvency of
                        the existing estate. If a feature's unit economics are negative, the strategic imperative is
                        deletion, not optimization.</p>
